# Press Any Key For Answers (PAKFA)

## Overview

Government data is increasingly being viewed as a national asset. However, these assets are independently managed, making the data fragmented and hard to navigate for researchers and policy makers. "Press Any Key For Answers" (PAKFA) is a single interface that helps user navigate this environment by dynamically understanding data available from across government.

## About GovHack

[GovHack](https://govhack.org/) is an annual open government data competition held all over Australia and New Zealand. A “hack” is when you take something and make it better - in this case, the target is Open Government Data. In 46 hours teams create a proof of concept and a 3 minute video that tells the story of how the data can be reused.

This project was created in response to a challenge posed during GovHack 2025, specifically ["Navigating Australia's Data Landscape"](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/navigating_australia_s_data_landscape).
