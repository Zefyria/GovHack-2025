# Navigating Australia’s Data Landscape

*Can you connect data users with the right data to answer their questions?*

[GovHack 2025 challenge](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/navigating_australia_s_data_landscape)

## Opportunity:

- Government data is a national asset
- ABS data forms part of a formidable evidence base for decision making across Australia
- data is regularly published by other federal departments, and at the state and local council levels

## Problem:

- government departments independently manage their own assets
- fragmented and hard to navigate
- volume and disparate host sites for such information can mean data gets overlooked or underutilised
- information siloes can inadvertently be created
- data users “don’t know what they don’t know”

## Solution:

- approach or prototype for creating a searchable "national inventory" of publicly available data
- single interface or solution that helps users navigate this environment by dynamically understanding data available from across government
  - description of available data assets
  - data readily available or does it need to be requested
  - downloaded or API
  - relationship between data sets
  - get what they need using natural language and/or intuitive searching
  - explainable and scalable
- simple view across their combined data holdings
- ABS and at least two other agencies with significant data holdings (at least one dataset from the ABS must be used)
## Impact:

- Finding the right data 
- help data consumers find the most appropriate data source(s) to meet their needs
- help users make sense of what is available
- unmask new links with other datasets they may never have considered
